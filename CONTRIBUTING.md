## How to contribute to GoDaddyPy

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/eXamadeus/godaddypy/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/eXamadeus/godaddypy/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Ensure the PR passes the tests and add new tests to cover the changes if needed.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability
of GoDaddyPy will generally not be accepted. Refactoring to make the code cleaner, is always welcome.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Awesome! Check for other issues first, then open a new one to discuss your idea.

#### **Do you have questions?**

* Ask any question about how to use GoDaddyPy in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/eXamadeus/godaddypy/discussions).

GoDaddyPy is a volunteer effort. I encourage you to pitch in. Thanks! :heart:
